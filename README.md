## Development

Development is done on `devel` branch, with feature branches.

To develop locally, install dependencies via

```bash
npm install
```

Then, run the website on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/) via

```bash
npm start
```

## Deployment

Production branch is `main` with Semver.

Deployment is done automatically via github actions for each push on main with version number in commit message on branch gh-pages

Manually, this can be achieved via

```bash
npm deploy
```

following [react-gh-pages](https://github.com/gitname/react-gh-pages).
